# K-State CS Hugo Theme V2

## [DEMO SITE](https://ksucs-hugo.russfeld.me/)

This is an adaptation of the [Hugo Relearn Theme](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/) that has been customized for use by K-State Computer Science to build online textbooks. It contains some features that are unique to our use case, but they may be useful to others.

Some unique features to this theme:
* Fonts and layouts customized to match K-State's websites and color scheme, as well as [Instructure Canvas](https://canvas.instructure.com/).
* Each page generates an embeddable version that strips menus, headers and footers (add /embed.html to almost any URL). This is meant to be embedded in an iFrame within another page, such as an HTML wiki page in Canvas. 
  * By doing so, we can embed course content in Canvas while editing it via Hugo, taking advantage of tools such as git for versioning. In addition, by updating the source website, all versions of the course in Canvas are updated immediately. 
* Each page also generates a teleprompter version to allow creation of course videos (add /tele.html to almost any URL). Many pages are used as a video script for multi-modal learning. 
  * The teleprompter pages include auto-scroll capabilities. It is compatible with an [IKAN Teleprompter Remote](https://ikancorp.com/shop/teleprompters/tablet-teleprompters-accessories/ikan-elite-remote-bluetooth-teleprompter-remote-for-pt-elite-prompters/), but can be controlled using the number keys or easily customized. See /static/js/tele-scroll.js for details.

# Quick Start Guide

This is a quick start guide for using this theme within a new Hugo website. 

1. [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) using the method of your choice. You will need a version of Hugo at 0.100.0 or later.
  1. I prefer to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) on Windows 10 coupled with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [WSL Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl). This allows native editing coupled with a Linux terminal. 
  1. On WSL, I usually download the .deb package from [Hugo Releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) and install it using `sudo dpkg -i <.deb file>`
2. Use Hugo to create a new site. See the [Hugo Quick Start Guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-2-create-a-new-site). 
  1. `hugo new site <website name>`
3. Install this repository as the theme. See the [Hugo Quick Start Guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-3-add-a-theme). 
  1. I recommend using Git submodules as directed in the Quick Start Guide. This allows you to pull updated versions of this template onto your site. 
  1. `git init`
  1. `git submodule add https://github.com/K-State-Computational-Core/hugo-theme-relearn /themes/hugo-theme-relearn`
4. Copy the contents of `config.toml.sample` in this repository to your `config.toml` file in the root of your Hugo website, and edit accordingly.
